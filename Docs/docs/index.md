# Creator Companion

## What Is It?
The VRChat Creator Companion (VCC) is the new Entry Point for creating things for VRChat! It currently includes our new [VRChat Package Manager (VPM)](vpm), and houses official packages, community packages, learning resources, tools, and more!

## Download It
The Creator Companion is available at [https://vrchat.com/home/download](https://vrchat.com/home/download). You can always download the latest version from this direct url as well: [https://vrchat.com/download/vcc](https://vrchat.com/download/vcc).

## Installer
The Creator Companion will be installed into your "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs" folder by default (e.g. `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs`). You can change this during installation if you like. You can delete the installer once the installation is complete.

## Requirements
The Creator Companion will check that Unity and Unity Hub are installed on launch. If it is needed, you will be guided through how to install both. If you follow these instructions, you will get the latest version of the Unity Hub and the current VRChat-SDK-Compatible version of Unity.

The Creator Companion is only fully-supported on Windows 10 (Windows 11 might work but it's not fully tested). The [CLI has some functionality on Mac and Linux](vpm/cli#mac-and-linux-support).

### Unity Editor Versions
The Creator Companion requires our currently supported Unity Version. It will automatically try to find it on your hard drive, or it can help you install it.
